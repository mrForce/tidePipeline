These are just notes that I take as I go along


---- 4/17/18 ------
I'm going to make it so that we only backup the actual sqlite DB file, and not the whole project. I need to change the begin_command_sesion, end_command_session, and possibly validate_project_integrity

Interesting, it appears that when adding assign confidence, I wasn't linking it to the tide search.

I'm adding a tPipeSaveAssignConfidencePeptides.py script. This lets the user export the peptides -- from PSMs that meet a q-value threshold criteria -- from an AssignConfidence run to a file, and will print out the number of unique peptides. If the export location is a folder, then the script should error out -- unless that folder is the null device (the user doesn't want to save the exporter peptides, they just want a count)
